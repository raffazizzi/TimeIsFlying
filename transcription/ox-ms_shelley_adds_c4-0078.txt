ILLEGIBLE warrior from ILLEGIBLE of ILLEGIBLE
To ILLEGIBLE from a ILLEGIBLE heir ILLEGIBLE
To change and be dead forever … 
Every but this from mine for never 
But now and then ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE 
But this in ill ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE by from ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE
ILLEGIBLE the moon and ILLEGIBLE all to climb 
ILLEGIBLE a ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE of heaven stays 
And ILLEGIBLE an although as ILLEGIBLE
From ILLEGIBLE on wings of ILLEGIBLE
ILLEGIBLE in the humble night
[Had I ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE height for just] (striked through) 
ILLEGIBLE [ILLEGIBLE to death] (striked through) for heat
In the heaven of the great --------
I ILLEGIBLE love, and I hate ILLEGIBLE
ILLEGIBLE am very true, 
Which ILLEGIBLE who ILLEGIBLE to the ILLEGIBLE
An enchanted heart cant hear 
[ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE past ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE] (striked through) 
Run into which be where from but stem
ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE of the hill 
And the the –ing ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE ILLEGIBLE

ILLEGIBLE as  if im ILLEGIBLE bend over ILLEGIBLE
Dignity ILLEGIBLE beneath or many more
