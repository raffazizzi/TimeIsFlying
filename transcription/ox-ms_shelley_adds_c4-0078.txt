 fair    coquette of Heaven,
[??] wanderer, <st>ivory</st>, <st> chang[??]</st> 
So when [from?] it has been given 
To change and be adored for ever.....
Envy not this dim mind, for never
but only written oh, [hang?] in [glos?]
   from   [this?]  as
She  left me at the silent time
When the moon had also ceased to climb
          <st>path</st>
The azure <st>dome</st> of Heaven's <st>[depth?]</st>, steep  //Looks like "dusk" to me, but I dunno. --VF
And like an albatross asleep
<st>[??]</st> Balanced on her wings of light  //Looks struck to me, still can't decipher it. --VF
[Hovered?] in the purple bright
<st> And I who sat beside her [best?] </st>   //I'm confident in "sat" because I had it on my page, but for some reason I can't agree with "best." --VF
The [??] <st> when to [??] the rest </st>
In the chamber of the heart.______
